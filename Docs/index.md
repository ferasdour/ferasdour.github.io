# Projects and such

Just wanted to use this as a test of mkdocs and obsidian, but I think storing stuff here and making it useful might actually be a benefit.

Lets see what we can do here:
## pyscript 
[[Pyscript-test]]

Did some playing with pyscript to see what I could do using python in a web browser. Long story short, basically javascript launched from python code. I say it like this because so much of it relies on javascript functionality forward and backward. I did several tests with it and my favorite has basically been using it as a mechanism to run xss attempts.

## dns 
[[dns]]

Created a project to learn more languages, so in classic multi-lingual style, making a single project that uses multiple languages and mimics the techniques from each language. It's a simple idea, generate a file to send to a the target, the file grabs every file on the user's home directory, ship it over dns requests to a one-time generated connection with interactsh to become a data stealing malware. 

This is only a proof of concept and not intended for malicious use, it's primary use is for learning and showcasing detection capabilities.

## Automation Tools

This is mostly just a collection of different simple scripts that I found a need for and was legally allowed to share (because of work agreements limiting what I could). So I have tools made with jupyter notebooks for controlling vms using libvirt/kvm, building containers from vms using ansible, a few simple bash scripts, and a few ansible tricks here and there.

## References
[[References]]

I'm sure everyone would rather this be references to people or something, but nope this is references to things like notes about scripting, fun commands, basically it's a cheat sheet for myself. Hope you can find some joy from this too.
