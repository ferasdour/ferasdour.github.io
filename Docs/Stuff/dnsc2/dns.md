# DNS Exfil over Interactsh
So, long story short here; I made a blog post (https://feemcotech.blogspot.com/2025/05/pyscript-nim-aaaaand-go.html) about my experiences learning different languages building example red team malware. I then decided I'd take those and make a simple controller for them since I was able to show a client that detections worked in some scenarios but not others. 

That's what this is. But I didn't leave it at just that yet. I wanted to see how different detections work against different programming languages implementing the exact same logic and for the tool to be able to spin those up.

## to build controller
```
go build .
```

## to build samples
check out the dependencies, I had some issues with nim throwing windows.h and other c library files that were accessible and in the path and what not. So I had to add additional options to the nim compile to get it to work

## crypting
This wasn't considered when making this, but there are many ways to hide this.

## Reading the exfil file
I know I could implement better logic, maybe use a special encoded option for "start new file" then give name, then "start data". but it seemed so much easier to just grab everything into one file (since it generates new binary on each run of the controller, to a new interactsh client callback) and use binwalk, foremost, or strings, hexdump, whatever to pull information out of it. 

The intention for this isn't to be used maliciously, but to showcase an ability for real attackers to exfiltrate data in a way that immediately compromises everything that was collected. That along with testing behavioral alerting instead of file by file alerting (one of the many benefits to modern EDR), seemed like a tool worth sharing.

## Other ways to run
This can be imported into a container, I haven't made one yet, but it seems pretty stright forward; ubuntu latest, install stuff needed, start with a file mount. Maybe use a bash script to start this so it generates a new local file for each container as it runs to mount for the /tmp/exfil, and maybe add a variable for the .exe name to change with each container. idk, maybe i'll work on that later. For now, i'm having more fun just going through different languages running this. 

## running examples:
I did 3 uploads:
```
https://app.any.run/tasks/c7131923-861c-48c6-a802-5ba55904054b - go test
https://app.any.run/tasks/1fdfa6c1-aca0-453b-a556-25ac5741016e - nim test
https://app.any.run/tasks/ad36533e-6214-40c2-8fcc-762b3e7706e9 - second go test (longer time)

hexdump -Cv /tmp/exfil
