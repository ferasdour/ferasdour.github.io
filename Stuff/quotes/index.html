<p>My wife has been telling me for some time now I should document some of my dreams. So I thought I'd add some backdated dreams, then start adding these as I'm able to.</p>
<h1 id="dreams">Dreams</h1>
<h2 id="interesting-game">Interesting game</h2>
<p>Had a dream about a game that's played roughly like battleship, but with multiple layers of 9x9 grids. Challenge is, you can only see the top-most row in any spot. You then are given, at random, coins with letters on them. Those coins, you have to guess where the letter is on any of the boards. If you run into a bomb, it destroys the space and makes it un-usable at all levels. You get points only for completed words. if you guess T on row 3 column 3, and T is the middle character, you get a point for that being there, and people can still guess above or below in that same area. If there isn't a T there, but a bomb on the 3rd layer, you and everyone who has already placed in that spot, lose that spot as being available.</p>
<p>on a 3x(9x9) board, bombs 6 total will be scattered amongst the layers.</p>
<h2 id="death-gates">Death gates</h2>
<p>As much as I can remember, there was this girl who was looking through a house (I guess with family) and saw there was a sweater. She moved the sweater onto the chair in a way that it couldn't easily be removed and walked out of the room. Then waited for it to be picked up. At which point a dead guy was trying to grab his sweater for the afterworld. She understood what he was doing and helped unhook it. Then I was the girl and I was with him to try to find the correct portal to move on through. These portals started popping out of the ground as we approached. We saw the first one, very typical stone door way, nothing exactly special but very classic "gateway to afterlife" thing. Then, we saw the next one, a little spookier, a little more scary but still stone and still staying still. Why do I word it like that? well then comes number 3, a walking... er... crawling... stone gateway. Then next one was like a dragon with it's mouth being the gateway. But like, where it could move but slowly and kinda hindered. Then there was the last one. This was much larger, much scarier dragon. Which immediately started chasing us. I figured we'd go to this tall building and go to the higher floors to try to outrun it. The guy said something about some sort of harry potter sounding cloak that could stop us from not just being seen but our presence erased. After running and hauling ass and trying to get there before being gobbled up by this demon portal... it just stopped. I was no longer in this dream it seemed. I was outside of it all, debating if this was the better path or if we should have headed back to the original house. Then suddenly, I realized what had happened. He put the cloak on me and sacrificed himself. </p>
<h1 id="old-dreams">Old dreams</h1>
<p>Just wanted to write some ones I remember that were somewhat important.</p>
<h2 id="lucifer-arrives-from-my-couch">Lucifer arrives from my couch</h2>
<p>This was exactly as it sounds, when I was like 10 had a dream where the devil and all the demons came from our couch. I watched as they slaughtered everyone around us. I went to lucifer, as we were spared because we inadvertently summoned him, and requested that they spare my friends and their families as well. Can't recall what he said, but he spoke roughly like "him" from powerpuff girls. This was before that show came out.</p>
<h2 id="dream-of-dog-dying-as-he-was-dying">Dream of dog dying as he was dying</h2>
<p>Slept on the couch one night as a kid. Had a dream about our dog toaster, trying to tell me things were going to be okay. Woke up to him dead at my feet.</p>
<h2 id="dream-of-pops-dying">Dream of pops dying</h2>
<p>Had a dream my grandfather was dying. I don't recall how close it was to when he died, but it was close enough I remember it seemingly next day. This was also a childhood dream.</p>
<h2 id="dream-my-former-friend-got-attacked">Dream my former friend got attacked</h2>
<p>A few years back, before I met my wife, had a dream of a friend that I had a falling out with (a few years even before this dream) being attacked and calling for help. Talked to a mutual friend of ours about it, who explained that night the former friend got forced to do some stuff when she didn't want to. </p>
<h2 id="head-rolling-dream">Head rolling dream</h2>
<p>I know this one is kind of a trope because everyone has these, but I had a dream as a kid of being decapitated. In doing so, I stayed present in my head enough to see my body drop. I don't currently remember but more about it, but if I remember i'll update this. </p></div>
